<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Karaage is a Japaneese-styled fried chicken which is cripsy, juicy, and intensively 
flavorful, which is even more impressive when you consider the fact that there
is no skin or bones involved.
</p>

<p>
    Karaage recipes are created equal and awesomeness is very much dependent
    on how and what you coat your chicken pieces in. It can be served with any
    starch, as for me, l will go with potato or macaronni.  
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Ingredients;</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 clove garlic, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon koshe salt</li>
