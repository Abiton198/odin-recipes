<p><div class="panna">
    A traditional, easy, and delicious <strong>Italian</strong> custard. It can be very difficult
    and not so easy to find one on the <em>internet</em>, so you should be prepared
    to make your own recipe for your own test. It tastes just like the panna conna
    served at Italian restaurants.
</p>

<p>
   <em>Panna-cotta</em> can be served with warm hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberries
    on top. This keeps well for several days in the <strong>refrigerator</strong>
