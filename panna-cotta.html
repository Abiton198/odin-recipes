<h1>Panna-cotta</h1>

<p>
    A traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. It can be very difficult
    and not so easy to find one on the internet, so you shoukd be prepared
    to make your own recipe for your own test. It tastes just like the panna conna
    served at Italian restaurants.
</p>

<p>
    Panna-cotta can be served with warm hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberries
    on top. This keeps well for several days in the refrigerator.
